            <article class="article__about__body">
              <p>
                Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re
                committed to making science accessible to all. Over the course
                of human history, science has developed from our early
                understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
                everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
                life itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
                experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even
                ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the
                world around us.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
                brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
                different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
                explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
                with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
                dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when
                everyone’s gone home).
              </p>
              <h3>Accessibility</h3>
              <p>
                The museum has wheelchair accessibility ramps. It also has audio
                guides and braille display signs for the visually impaired.
              </p>
              <h3>Food and Drink</h3>
              <p>
                There is a café attached to the museum where you can get light
                lunches, soft drinks, coffee, snacks and more.
              </p>
              <h3>Shop</h3>
              <p>
                Our shop offers a range of memorabilia from the museum as well
                as great gifts and activity packs that allow you to continue to
                explore science even after you’ve left the museum.
              </p>
              <h3>Volunteer</h3>
              <p>
                A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
                displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
                Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
                scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
                monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
                discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
                contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get
                involved.
              </p>

                <h3>Support us</h3>
                <p>
                  There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations
                  are very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum
                  open and accessible to the whole community. You can also
                  support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s

                <p>
                  Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the
                  fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with
                  people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an
                  internship at the museum. You’ll be learning from a number of
                  different academics and people who are passionate about
                  science and sharing it with the wider community.
